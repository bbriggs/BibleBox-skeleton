 <span class="verse"> <a name="V1">1&nbsp;</a></span>Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:  <span class="verse"> <a name="V2">2&nbsp;</a></span>and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V3">3&nbsp;</a></span>Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,  <span class="verse"> <a name="V4">4&nbsp;</a></span>saying, “I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood.” </div><div class='p'>But they said, “What is that to us? You see to it.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V5">5&nbsp;</a></span>He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. He went away and hanged himself.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V6">6&nbsp;</a></span>The chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, “It’s not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.”  <span class="verse"> <a name="V7">7&nbsp;</a></span>They took counsel, and bought the potter’s field with them, to bury strangers in.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V8">8&nbsp;</a></span>Therefore that field was called “The Field of Blood” to this day.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V9">9&nbsp;</a></span>Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah<a href="#FN1" onclick="hilite('FN1')"><span class="notemark">*</span><span class="popup">some manuscripts omit “Jeremiah”</span></a> the prophet was fulfilled, saying, </div><div class='q'>“They took the thirty pieces of silver, </div><div class='q2'>the price of him upon whom a price had been set, </div><div class='q2'>whom some of the children of Israel priced, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V10">10&nbsp;</a></span>and they gave them for the potter’s field, </div><div class='q2'>as the Lord commanded me.”<a href="#FN2" onclick="hilite('FN2')"><span class="notemark">✡</span><span class="popup">Zechariah 11:12-13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V11">11&nbsp;</a></span>Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?” </div><div class='p'>Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“So you say.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V12">12&nbsp;</a></span>When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V13">13&nbsp;</a></span>Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many things they testify against you?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V14">14&nbsp;</a></span>He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marvelled greatly.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V15">15&nbsp;</a></span>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V16">16&nbsp;</a></span>They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V17">17&nbsp;</a></span>When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?”  <span class="verse"> <a name="V18">18&nbsp;</a></span>For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V19">19&nbsp;</a></span>While he was sitting on the judgement seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of him.”  <span class="verse"> <a name="V20">20&nbsp;</a></span>Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V21">21&nbsp;</a></span>But the governor answered them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” </div><div class='p'>They said, “Barabbas!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V22">22&nbsp;</a></span>Pilate said to them, “What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?” </div><div class='p'>They all said to him, “Let him be crucified!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V23">23&nbsp;</a></span>But the governor said, “Why? What evil has he done?” </div><div class='p'>But they cried out exceedingly, saying, “Let him be crucified!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V24">24&nbsp;</a></span>So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V25">25&nbsp;</a></span>All the people answered, “May his blood be on us, and on our children!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V26">26&nbsp;</a></span>Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V27">27&nbsp;</a></span>Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V28">28&nbsp;</a></span>They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V29">29&nbsp;</a></span>They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they knelt down before him, and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”  <span class="verse"> <a name="V30">30&nbsp;</a></span>They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V31">31&nbsp;</a></span>When they had mocked him, they took the robe off of him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V32">32&nbsp;</a></span>As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V33">33&nbsp;</a></span>When they came to a place called “Golgotha”, that is to say, “The place of a skull,”  <span class="verse"> <a name="V34">34&nbsp;</a></span>they gave him sour wine<a href="#FN3" onclick="hilite('FN3')"><span class="notemark">†</span><span class="popup">or, vinegar</span></a> to drink mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V35">35&nbsp;</a></span>When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing amongst them, casting lots,<a href="#FN4" onclick="hilite('FN4')"><span class="notemark">‡</span><span class="popup">TR adds “that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet: ‘They divided my garments amongst them, and for my clothing they cast lots;’” [see Psalm 22:18 and John 19:24]</span></a>  <span class="verse"> <a name="V36">36&nbsp;</a></span>and they sat and watched him there.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V37">37&nbsp;</a></span>They set up over his head the accusation against him written, “THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V38">38&nbsp;</a></span>Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V39">39&nbsp;</a></span>Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,  <span class="verse"> <a name="V40">40&nbsp;</a></span>and saying, “You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V41">41&nbsp;</a></span>Likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes, the Pharisees,<a href="#FN5" onclick="hilite('FN5')"><span class="notemark">§</span><span class="popup">TR omits “the Pharisees”</span></a> and the elders, said,  <span class="verse"> <a name="V42">42&nbsp;</a></span>“He saved others, but he can’t save himself.

Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”  <span class="verse"> <a name="V44">44&nbsp;</a></span>The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V45">45&nbsp;</a></span>Now from the sixth hour<a href="#FN6" onclick="hilite('FN6')"><span class="notemark">**</span><span class="popup">noon</span></a> there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.<a href="#FN7" onclick="hilite('FN7')"><span class="notemark">††</span><span class="popup">3:00 p.m.</span></a>  <span class="verse"> <a name="V46">46&nbsp;</a></span>About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <span class='wj'>“Eli, Eli, lima</span><a href="#FN8" onclick="hilite('FN8')"><span class="notemark">‡‡</span><span class="popup">TR reads “lama” instead of “lima”</span></a> <span class='wj'>sabachthani?” </span> That is, <span class='wj'>“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</span><a href="#FN9" onclick="hilite('FN9')"><span class="notemark">✡</span><span class="popup">Psalm 22:1</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V47">47&nbsp;</a></span>Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V48">48&nbsp;</a></span>Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V49">49&nbsp;</a></span>The rest said, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to save him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V50">50&nbsp;</a></span>Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V51">51&nbsp;</a></span>Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V52">52&nbsp;</a></span>The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;  <span class="verse"> <a name="V53">53&nbsp;</a></span>and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V54">54&nbsp;</a></span>Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, “Truly this was the Son of God.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V55">55&nbsp;</a></span>Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V56">56&nbsp;</a></span>Amongst them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V57">57&nbsp;</a></span>When evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself was also Jesus’ disciple came.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V58">58&nbsp;</a></span>This man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V59">59&nbsp;</a></span>Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,  <span class="verse"> <a name="V60">60&nbsp;</a></span>and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V61">61&nbsp;</a></span>Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V62">62&nbsp;</a></span>Now on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,  <span class="verse"> <a name="V63">63&nbsp;</a></span>saying, “Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: ‘After three days I will rise again.’  <span class="verse"> <a name="V64">64&nbsp;</a></span>Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He is risen from the dead;’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V65">65&nbsp;</a></span>Pilate said to them, “You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can.”  <span class="verse"> <a name="V66">66&nbsp;</a></span>So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone. </div><hr>
