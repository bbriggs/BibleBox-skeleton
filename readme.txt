The BibleBox is a self-contained wifi file server that is built with open source code and cheap portable hardware. It runs on the TP-Link MR3040 which has its own builtin battery providing you with a portable digital resource wifi distribution tool (share books, video, audio...any digital file) 

The BibleBox can easily fit in your pocket.

The BibleBox was conceived by Campbell Smythe (http://www.cdsmythe.com) as a means to share digital Christian Bibles and other resources using wifi.  The software code behind BibleBox is licensed under under GPLv2, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html for license details.
