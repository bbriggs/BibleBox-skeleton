 <span class="verse"> <a name="V1">1&nbsp;</a></span>Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V2">2&nbsp;</a></span>The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V3">3&nbsp;</a></span>Satan entered into Judas, who was also called Iscariot, who was counted with the twelve.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V4">4&nbsp;</a></span>He went away, and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V5">5&nbsp;</a></span>They were glad, and agreed to give him money.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V6">6&nbsp;</a></span>He consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V7">7&nbsp;</a></span>The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.  <span class="verse"> <a name="V8">8&nbsp;</a></span>He sent Peter and John, saying, <span class='wj'>“Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V9">9&nbsp;</a></span>They said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V10">10&nbsp;</a></span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you.

But one who is the greater amongst you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves. </span>  <span class="verse"> <a name="V27">27&nbsp;</a></span> <span class='wj'>For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn’t it he who sits at the table?

You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V31">31&nbsp;</a></span>The Lord said, <span class='wj'>“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat, </span>  <span class="verse"> <a name="V32">32&nbsp;</a></span> <span class='wj'>but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn’t fail.
